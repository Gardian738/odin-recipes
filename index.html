        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef Stroganoff is a Russian dish that has become widspread in the world. It can also be found under the names "Meat Stroganoff", "Beef Stroganoff", "Beef a la Stroganoff".
            As is often the case with popular dishes, there is no single version of the history of beef stroganoff. It is only known for sure that it is connected with the of Count Stroganov. 
            Now a little about the ingredients. Here, in general, there is nothing incomprehensible, the only thing I would like to draw your attention to is meat. Ideally, it should be fresh beef tenderloin, but, for example, in our stores the word “fresh” rarely fits the tenderloin that is sold, and it is also quite expensive. Therefore, in the absence of a good tenderloin, take fresh beef pulp (without veins). From the indicated amount of ingredients, 4-6 servings of beef stroganoff are obtained.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef 500 g.;</li>
            <li>Onions 1 pc. (150-200 g.);</li>
            <li>Sour cream 150 g.;</li>
            <li>Flour 1 tbsp. spoon;</li>
            <li>Tomato paste 1 teaspoon;</li>
            <li>Water 150 ml.;</li>
            <li>Salt;</li>
            <li>Black pepper;</li>
            <li>Bay leaf 1 pc.;</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil 2 tbsp.;</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare all the necessary ingredients for beef stroganoff according to the classic beef recipe;</li>
            <li>Rinse beef flesh, pat dry. If there is a spit on the meat or veins, cut it out with a sharp knife. Cut the beef into small strips, 4-4.5 cm long, beat off with the blunt side of the knife if the meat is young and tender. You need to cut the meat across the fibers so that the beef is soft when cooked. If you are not sure about the quality of the purchased beef or use a tougher part for beef stroganoff, you can pre-beat the raw meat with a special kitchen hammer, and then cut it.</li>
            <li>Peel the onion from the husk, rinse. Cut the onion into 4 parts and crumble each into half rings.</li>
            <li>Fry the whole beef in parts in a preheated pan, with the addition of vegetable oil. Fry over high heat until golden brown. It is important to divide the meat into 2-3 parts so that each part is well browned. If all the meat is fried together, the beef will begin to give juice and will be stewed in its own juice. There will be no roasting effect. It is better to fry the meat in stages in a large frying pan. Remove cooked meat from the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the onion in the pan where the meat was fried. If necessary, add a little vegetable oil. Onions should become a beautiful golden color, you need to fry for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add fried beef to the fried onion, mix everything well.</li>
            <li>Pour a tablespoon of flour into the pan to the meat with onions. Mix everything again and fry for 1 minute. In some recipes for beef stroganoff, the meat is rolled in flour before frying. But flour is needed to thicken the sauce, so it must be added at this stage already to the fried meat.</li>
            <li>Add sour cream and tomato paste to beef. Combine all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pour 200 ml of boiling water over beef to get a thick sauce. A little more water may be needed, it all depends on the time the beef stroganoff is stewed.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste, black pepper, bay leaf. Mix everything again, the mass should be thick.</li>
            <li>Stew beef stroganoff over low heat, covering the pan with a lid. It is important to stew the meat in a pan with a thick bottom or, even better, in a cauldron. Simmer for 40 minutes or longer, stirring the gravy from time to time. Add some hot water if necessary. The beef should be very soft and tender, and the gravy should be fragrant and thick.</li>
            <li>Classic beef stroganoff is best served with mashed potatoes. This combination is familiar and loved by many. Fragrant gravy, tender pieces of beef and airy mashed potatoes - this is a classic of home cooking that will always be relevant. Bon appetit.</li>
